# Weekly Challenge #23 - Unconventional Randomness

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that generates random numbers using unconventional inputs.** Cloudflare is famous for getting random numbers out of a series of lava lamps in their offices. Can you think of out of the box idea on how to get random numbers?

### Winners:

The winner for $75 is @Nakatox! This entry generates random numbers extending a seed by running a physics simulation. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-23-unconventional-randomness/issues/4

Unfortunately was submitted late but @nicogs takes the physics simulation to the next level! It uses the idea of a double pendulum with a tiny variation to generate vastly different results using Chaos theory. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-23-unconventional-randomness/issues/8

In second place for $50 is @alshakero! This is likely the most practical solution to generate random numbers: use the timing differences between web workers calls. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-23-unconventional-randomness/issues/1

In third place for $25 is @Krayorn! By conception, bitcoin uses a random number for the hash, so fetching the latest bitcoin hashes is giving great random numbers, even though public... https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-23-unconventional-randomness/issues/7

Honorable mention for @philip-edekobi! This is the literal definition of thinking outside of the box, using Internal Space Station current coordinates as source of randomness! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-23-unconventional-randomness/issues/5

Honorable mention for @Uzo2005! Using sha256sum of the live stream feed of Time Square in New York you are getting a constant source of random numbers! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-21-unconventional-clock/issues/2

Honorable mention for @seanyang0813! This uses a specific scheme to go through bits of audio data, the best part is that it passes automated randomness tests! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-23-unconventional-randomness/issues/3

Last but not least, honorable mention for @omnisnash! Using mouse input was the first think I thought of for this challenge, very practical and well executed! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-23-unconventional-randomness/issues/2
